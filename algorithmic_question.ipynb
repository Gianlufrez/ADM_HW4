    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "An imaginary university wants to restrict its student’s entrance to the campus. Suppose that there are N entrances, M students and G guards. Due to the security measures, each student is known to be assigned a gate through which they should enter the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The N entrances will be numbered from 1 to N. Regarding one entry, the entrance will be opened right before the first student’s arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last student that should enter through that specific entrance. We will assume that two students can not enter the university simultaneously. For an entry to be protected, a guard should be assigned to it. Notice that a guard cannot leave his post until the door he was given is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the university's head of the guards knows the order in which the students are coming to the university (yeah, they know you more than you know about yourself!). He wants you to help him if having only G guards is enough to address the restrictions they wish to apply (in other words, whether there will be a moment when more than G entrances should be opened or not)."
