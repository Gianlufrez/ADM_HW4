    "#### The idea behind the algorithm is that\n",
    "* we map the guards and students to a specific gate.\n",
    "* we find the gate where the next student will be let in.\n",
    "* if the gate has a guard, we can let the student in.\n",
    "* if the gate does not have a guard, we try to assign on. If there are no free guards, we know that don't have enough guards because all guards are supervising gates where students are still waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a pool of guards that \n",
    "* we remove guards from when we have a gate that has students waiting but no guard\n",
    "* we add guards to when a guard has let in all the students that are waiting at the gate.\n",

    "Here are the steps of the algorithm.\n",

    "            \n",
    "        if there are no free guards:\n",
    "            break the loop because all guards are occupied\n",
    "            \n",
    "    if the gate has no more students waiting:\n",
    "        remove guard and put back into the guard pool.\n",

    "Each gate object will have a queue students and a guard. We get the gate where the next student will be let in with the help of a priority queue."
